Taser Chess is played exactly like regular chess- with a twist. As you play, an AI that is (hopefully) capable of predicting the best possible next option is constantly watching you move your pieces. If the AI determines that your move was a mistake or blunder, however, the AI will teach you to not make the same mistakes twice.

Of course, it doesn't just explain why the move was a mistake and how not to make it again. No, of course not. That would be far too productive and effective. A much better option, of course, is to just taze them. Fear is a strong motivator :)

So, if you haven't realized yet, this is not an actual way to learn how to play chess. I just thought of the idea of "chess, but with taser" and ran with it and wanted some dumb justification for it :p Either way it's really funny to watch people play it and that's honestly all that matters.

ALSO do NOT do this to people who don't want to/know what they're getting into. As funny as it would be, strapping in someone who doesn't know they're getting tazed is just an asshole move. Do not do it ðŸ”«.
