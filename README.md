Taser Chess is played exactly like regular chess, now with pain! As you play, an AI that is (hopefully) capable of predicting the best possible next option is constantly watching you move your pieces. If the AI determines that your move was a mistake, however, the AI will teach you to not make the same bad move twice.

Of course, it doesn't just explain why the move was a mistake and how not to make it again. That would be far too productive and effective, that's disgusting. A much better option, of course, is to just taze them. Fear is a strong motivator :D

Honestly I just thought of the idea of "chess, but with taser" was funny and ran with it and wanted some dumb justification for it. Either way it's really funny to watch people play it and that's honestly all that matters.

**Also, feel free to fuck with the code however you like.
